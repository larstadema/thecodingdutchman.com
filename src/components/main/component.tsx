      <h3>Fullstack Javascript</h3>
      <p>
        My expertise lies within the Javascript ecosystem. I have worked on multiple frontend and
        backend production-grade applications. Examples of technologies I am familiar with are:
        ReactJS, NodeJS, NoSQL, Redis, AWS and Typescript

      <h3>Bartender</h3>
      <p>
        Next to developing, I have a history working as a bartender focused on cocktails. Combining
        the right ingrediÃ«nts is a task that both developers and cocktail shakers practice every
        day! Next to that in both professions presentation is key! Cocktails and code should be
        pieced together from the right parts and also look like quality.

      <h3>Thinker</h3>
      <p>
        I will always try and think of improvements that can be made in a project or codebase. These
        could be performance improvements, introducing new technologies, or setting up documentation
        for teams regarding principles and guidelines. All in all, I will always strive to improve
        not only myself but also others.
